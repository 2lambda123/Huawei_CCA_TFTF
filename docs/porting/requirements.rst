Platform Requirements
=====================

The TF-A Tests rely on the following features to be present on the platform and
accessible from Normal World.

-  Watchdog
-  Non-Volatile Memory
-  System Timer

This also means that a platform port of the TF-A Tests must include software
drivers for those features.
