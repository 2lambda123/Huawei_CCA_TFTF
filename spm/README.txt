This is a prototype loosely based on the SPCI Beta1 specification.
Any interface / platform API introduced for this is subject to
change as it evolves.

Cactus is meant to be the main test Secure Partition run at S-EL1.
It is the one meant to have most of the tests that a Secure Partition
has to do. Ivy is meant to be more minimalistic and run at S-EL0.
